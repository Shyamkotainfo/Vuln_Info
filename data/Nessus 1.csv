95631,CVE-2004-2761,,None,10.10.1.21,tcp,443,SSL Certificate Signed Using Weak Hashing Algorithm (Known CA),A known CA SSL certificate in the certificate chain has been signed using a weak hashing algorithm.,"The remote service uses a known CA certificate in the SSL certificate chain that has been signed using a cryptographically weak hashing algorithm (e.g., MD2, MD4, MD5, or SHA1). These signature algorithms are known to be vulnerable to collision attacks. An attacker can exploit this to generate another certificate with the same digital signature, allowing the attacker to masquerade as the affected service.

Note that this plugin reports all SSL certificate chains signed with SHA-1 that expire after January 1, 2017 as vulnerable. This is in accordance with Google's gradual sunsetting of the SHA-1 cryptographic hash algorithm.",Contact the Certificate Authority to have the certificate reissued.,"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3279

70658,CVE-2008-5161,2.6,Low,10.10.1.230,tcp,22,SSH Server CBC Mode Ciphers Enabled,The SSH server is configured to use Cipher Block Chaining.,"The SSH server is configured to support Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) encryption.  This may allow an attacker to recover the plaintext message from the ciphertext. 

Note that this plugin only checks for the options of the SSH server and does not check for vulnerable software versions.","Contact the vendor or consult product documentation to disable CBC mode cipher encryption, and enable CTR or GCM cipher mode encryption.",,
78479,CVE-2014-3566,4.3,Medium,10.10.1.230,tcp,443,SSLv3 Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption Vulnerability (POODLE),It is possible to obtain sensitive information from the remote host with SSL/TLS-enabled services.,"The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.
MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.

As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can be 'rolled back' to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the client and service.

The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents 'version rollback' attacks without impacting legacy clients; however, it can only protect connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.

This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to completely mitigate the vulnerability.","Disable SSLv3.

Services that must support SSLv3 should enable the TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism until SSLv3 can be disabled.","https://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/10/14/poodle.html
